                ROSS - Rotordynamics Open-Source Software is a library written in Python
                for rotordynamic analyses. It's developed by Petrobr√°s and Federal
                University of Rio de Janeiro.
                It allows the construction of rotor models and their
                numerical simulation. Shaft elements, as a default, are modeled with the
                Timoshenko beam theory, which considers shear and rotary inertia
                effects, and discretized by means of the Finite Element Method. Disks
                are assumed to be rigid bodies, thus their strain energy is not taken
                into account. And bearings/seals are included as linear
                stiffness/damping coefficients.

                ROSS carries out several different analyses which include:
                1. Static analysis;
                2. Modal analysis - Natural frequencies and mode shapes determination;
                3. Damped and undemped critical speed analysis;
                4. Unbalance response analysis;
                5. Time domain linear analysis;
                6. Stability analysis of the rotor.
